# 💙 WeMake AI Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers

This repository is a collection of _reference implementations_ for the
[Model Context Protocol](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/) (MCP), as well as references to community built servers and
additional resources.

The servers in this repository showcase the versatility and extensibility of MCP, demonstrating how it can be used to
give Large Language Models (LLMs) secure, controlled access to tools and data sources. Typically, each MCP server is
implemented with an MCP SDK:

- [Typescript MCP SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk)

## 🌟 Servers

These servers aim to demonstrate MCP features and the official SDKs.

- **[Deep Thinking](src/deep-thinking)** - Dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thought sequences.
- **[Knowledge Graph Memory](src/knowledge-graph-memory)** - Persistent memory for through a local knowledge graph.
- **[Tasks](src/tasks)** - Self guided task planning, management, execution and completion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Using MCP Servers in this Repository

Typescript-based servers in this repository can be used directly with `bunx`.

For example, this will start the [Deep Thinking](src/deep-thinking) server:

```sh
bunx -y @wemake-ai/mcpserver-deep-thinking@latest
```

Python-based servers in this repository can be used directly with [`uvx`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/tools/) or
[`pip`](https://pypi.org/project/pip/). `uvx` is recommended for ease of use and setup.

For example, this will start the [Git](src/git) server:

```sh
# With uvx
uvx mcp-server-git

# With pip
pip install mcp-server-git
python -m mcp_server_git
```

Follow [these](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) instructions to install `uv` / `uvx` and
[these](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/) to install `pip`.

### Using an MCP Client

However, running a server on its own isn't very useful, and should instead be configured into an MCP client. For
example, here's the Claude Desktop configuration to use the above server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "memory": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@wemake-ai/mcp-memory"]
    }
  }
}
```

Additional examples of using the Claude Desktop as an MCP client might look like:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "filesystem": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@wemake-ai/mcp-filesystem", "/path/to/allowed/files"]
    },
    "git": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["mcp-server-git", "--repository", "path/to/git/repo"]
    },
    "github": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@wemake-ai/mcp-github"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN": "<YOUR_TOKEN>"
      }
    },
    "postgres": {
      "command": "bunx",
      "args": ["-y", "@wemake-ai/mcp-postgres", "postgresql://localhost/mydb"]
    }
  }
}
```
